        <p class="text-white pb-6">How does OVH secure your personal data?</p>

        <p class="text-white">For data collected online, communications on the client side are encrypted between the
          user's computer and our servers (HTTPS secure zone). The data is then saved on our secure servers hosted by
          OVH. This hosting provider is committed to not reusing
          the personal data stored on the secure servers of their customers. OVH guarantees that it does not process
          your information outside the European Union or any country recognized by the European Commission as having an
          adequate level of protection of personal data (with regard to
          the protection of privacy, fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals, and with regard to the exercise of
          the corresponding rights).</p>

        <p class="text-white pb-6">For all of its services, OVH undertakes to put in place :</p>

        <ul class="text-white pb-6">
          <li>- Physical security measures to prevent access to the infrastructures by unauthorized persons;</li>
          <li>- Security personnel responsible for ensuring the physical security of our premises 24 hours a day, 7 days
            a week;</li>
          <li>- A permissions management system to limit access to the premises and data to authorized persons only,
            within the scope of their functions and activities;</li>
          <li>- A system of physical and/or logical isolation (depending on the service) of clients from each other;
          </li>
          <li>- Strong authentication processes for users and administrators, thanks in particular to a strict password
            management policy and the deployment of certain double
            authentication measures such as YubiKey;</li>
          <li>- Processes and devices that allow us to trace all actions carried out on our information system and, in
            accordance with the regulations in force, to make reports in
            the event of an incident affecting our customers' data.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-white pb-6">How does the Sendinblue platform secure your personal data?</p>

        <p class="text-white pb-6">The Sendinblue platform has implemented all the necessary infrastructures to
          safeguard and protect your personal data.
          The platform is transparent only in the measures implemented:
          https://help.sendinblue.com/hc/fr/categories/360000229110-RGPD
          The hosting servers are located exclusively within the European Union, on their own servers, on Google Cloud
          or on AWS. All data is replicated three times in at least two different geographies. SendinBlue also makes
          regular backups of your data
          (at least once a week). These are encrypted before being stored on a Cloud Storage (AWS or Google Cloud). In
          addition, the Platform has set up a traceability of this data throughout the processing carried out thanks to
          a system of monitoring and identification of logs.
          Archiving is carried out solely for legal reasons, and the databases are then purged at the end of the
          retention period.</p>

        <p class="text-white pb-10">All data centers are equipped with a multi-level security model (designed electronic
          access cards, alarms, security gates and fences, metal detectors and biometric technologies). As part of their
          security protocol, engineers authenticate themselves using short-lived personal public key certificates.
          Finally, Sendinblue works with a cyber security consulting firm that has complimented them on how difficult
          their systems are to break into.</p>
