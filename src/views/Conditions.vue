        Noffta will cancel the order without any possibility for the customer to contest. The customer will be informed by our accounting department.

      <p class="text-white pb-6">Ownership and liability</p>
  
      <p class="text-white pb-6">Contract and NFTs: </p>
  
      <p class="text-white pb-6">NFTs will be linked to a contract of assignment of rights with the author of the work. This contract must be written and signed. It cannot be drawn up before the creation of the work. It includes the particulars of the copyright, 
        the guarantees and the obligations of the parties (remuneration and transfer of rights). The contract will also be adapted with the blockchain technology. 
        A commission indicated during the creation of the NFT will be taken on commercial actions related to an NFT.</p>
      
      <p class="text-white pb-6">For individuals who use NFTs with traditional digital assets (Ether, bitcoin...), the sale of tokens is taxed at 30%. Therefore, there are no taxes that are levied on the capital gain with exchanges for digital assets. However, 
        if an NFT is qualified as intangible personal property, the capital gain it generates is taxed at 36.2% after the implementation of a holding period allowance. 
        If the NFT has been qualified as a work of art, it is subject to a fixed tax of 6.5% of its price.</p>
      
      <p class="text-white pb-6">An NFT is always accompanied by its metadata. The metadata is the information about it and it is stored on the blockchain. It is usually stored outside the NFT itself with some exceptions. The metadata is pointed to by a 
        cryptographic uniform resource identifier (URI) referenced in the token. This identifier can be sent to various locations. 
        It can be a website specified by the creator of the nft, it can also be an IPF address or other locations that the NFT application may allow.</p>
  
      <p class="text-white">Jurisdiction clause</p>
      <p class="text-white pb-6">All disputes relating to our sales will be submitted exclusively to the courts of Montbéliard.</p>
